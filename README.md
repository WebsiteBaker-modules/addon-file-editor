The latest version and code changes of the ***wb-addon-file-editor*** admin tool can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/cwsoft/wb-addon-file-editor).

## About Addon File Editor

The Addon File Editor ***(AFE)*** enables you to view, edit, delete, create, upload or backup files of installed Add-ons such as modules, templates and languages from the WebsiteBaker backend without downloading the files first. You can also create installation packages off installed Add-ons, ready for installation from the WebsiteBaker backend. 

Optionally, you can activate the FTP layer, which allows you to access Add-ons normally owned by the ftp-user (like WB core templates or core modules uploaded via FTP). AFE also integrates the 3rd party online photo editing service [Pixlr](http://pixlr.com), which allows you to edit images using a Photoshop like environment.

## Prerequisites

The Addon File Editor was tested with ***WebsiteBaker v2.8.2***.
